I love getting faster in my workflow, something I have recently added in is
creating GitHub repos with the cli.  I often create little examples of
projects, but they just end up on my machine and not anywhere that someone else
can see, mostly because it takes more effort to go create a repo.  TIL you can
create a repo right from the command line and push to it immediately.

``` bash
gh repo create waylonwalker-cli
```

## want to see what this repo I created is about?

Check out what I created here.

```
pipx run waylonwalker
```
