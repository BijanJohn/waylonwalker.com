## Markata

I open sourced the static site framework that I use to build
[my-blog](https://waylonwalker.com/) among other side projects.  It's a plugins
all the way down static site  generator, that makes me happy to use.

A plugins all the way down static site generator written in python.  Plugins all the way down means that you can completely change the behavior of how it works by swapping plugins, installing new ones, or creating your own all in python.

A todo plugin for markata.  It is a tui (text user interface) that runs in the terminal using textual.  It gives me a trello-board feel from the terminal.  I can create, update, delete, move, and fully manage my todo items from the terminal with it.

A slides plugin for markata that allows you to create presentations in markdown from the comfort of your favorite editor.  Each new h2 tag (## in markdown) becomes a new slide.  This plugin leverages the built-in feeds plugin for navigation, and adds in some hotkeys (j/k) to go the the previous and next slides.

## Repos used to build this blog

[my-blog](https://waylonwalker.com/) is built on a number of small repos.  I
set it up this way so that creating content is fast and easy to do. I don't
have to worry about carrying around large images with my lightweight text
files just to make some posts.

## Kedro

I am a heavy user of the [kedro](https://kedro.org) framework, and a big
advocate for using some sort of DAG framework for your data pipelines.  kedro
is built all in python which makes it easy for a python dev like me to extend,
run, maintain, and deploy.

## Neovim Plugins

I use vim for all of my text editing needs.  It brings me joy to make any part
of it just a bit smoother.  I have written a few plugins that help me achieve
that silky smooth workflow.
