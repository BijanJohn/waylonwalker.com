I spoke at python webconf in March 2022 about how I deploy this blog on a
continuous basis.

Building this blog has brought me a lot of benefits.  I have
a set of custom curated notes to help describe a problem and how to solve it to
me.  At theis point it's not uncommon to google an Issue I am having and
finding my own blog with exactly the solution I need at the top.

I also bump into people from time to time that recognize me from the blog, its
a nice conversation starter, and street cred.

## The Talk

The talk recently released on Youtube, you can watch it without having a ticket
to the conference for free.  There were a bunch of other talks that you should
check out too!
